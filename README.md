# BudgE
BudgE (pronounced "budgie", like the bird) is an open source "budgeting with envelopes" personal finance app, taking inspiration from other tools such as [Aspire Budgeting](https://www.aspirebudget.com/), [budgetzero](https://budgetzero.io/), and [Buckets](https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/).

:warning: BudgE still under active development and considered an 'alpha' version until more tests can be written to ensure functionality is maintained. :warning:
